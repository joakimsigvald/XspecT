* Return different pipeline after setup and run, and remove the HasRun guard clauses
* Verbose mode (static) that prints description after running each test
* Return different values on each call by:
Given<Service>.That(_ => _.DoesSomething()).Returns(1).AndThen().Returns(2).AndThen().Throws(new Exception())
* throw SetupFailed if providing a value to Use, which is not used, for instance when Given(new ConcreteClass()), 
  that was expected to be used instead of mocking IAbstractInterface,
  hinting that it should be provided as Given<IAbstractInterface>(new ConcreteClass())
