* Comment all public methods
* Allow chain of method calls with And: When(_ => MethodA()).And(_ => MethodB())
* Allow next method call in chain to use result of previous: When(_ => MethodA()).And((_, res) => MethodB(res))
* When providing concrete class several levels down in component hierarchy, 
  materialize all components that use that class up to the subject under test (i.e. create concrete instances instead of mocks).
